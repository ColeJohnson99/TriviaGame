GifTastic:  A website to fetch animated images from around the interverse!  Simply select one of the carefully curated topic buttons, wait a second or two, and just like that all the moving imagery you could ever need!  Tired of a certain topic? Simply select another topic and just like that your desktop is flooded with the best imagery the World Wide Web has to offer.


**The site was built in VSS. Gifs are grabbed from the Giphy website, using a user generated API key from Giphy. While messing around with the code and testing the webpage, my Gifs stopped loading in.  Unable to find a problem with my code I checked the console and was given a Giphy API key error.  The error states that "API rate limit exceeded", not letting me call anymore gifs from Giphy.  I am relatively sure each button works though I am unable to check as no gifs will load in.
